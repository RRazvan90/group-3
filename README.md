Degree Prospects  In this project we will be analysing the salaries at entry level and mid-career of different degree holders across discipline (degree major),regions and type of univerisities. We have utilized the following 3 datasets which are stored in the resources folder.#
 degrees-that-pay-back.csv
 salaries-by-college-type.csv
 salaries-by-region.csv

Analysis  : 
The first step was to clean the data which included making sure that the data in the salary columns was numeric so we could use mathematical functions on it. We then proceeded to either get rid of the nan values by either removing them or  substituting it with the mean so as to have a more accurate representation in our graph.


Analysis across Type of Universities:




Analysis of university salaries by region :
The best salaries are found in universities in the north-eastern region,
where the Ivy schools are, followed by the universities found in California, 
which again, not that surprising as that region has universities that are at 
the level of Ivy League schools.
